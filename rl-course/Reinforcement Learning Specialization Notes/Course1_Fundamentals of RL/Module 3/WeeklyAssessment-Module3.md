Instructions: You will devise three example tasks of your own that fit in the MDP framework, identifying for each its states, actions and rewards. Make three examples as different from each other as possible.

#### Minecraft NPC Farmer MDP
My first example would be a **Minecraft NPC Farmer**. The **states** would be the information about the soil and crop, where a planted crop grows at a rate in each time step. The states of the soil would be any of the following: grass, ploughed, sowed, and dry. Then for the crop, it will be from stage 1 to 5. The **actions** of the agent will be sowing, ploughing, watering, stopping, and harvesting. The **rewards** could be -1 at each time step to encourage the agent to quickly reach the goal of harvesting a crop, certain positive rewards for doing the right actions sequentially (ploughing, sowing, watering), harvesting too early i.e. harvesting at stage < 5 will merit -10 , and +100 for harvesting a single crop.

#### Minecraft NPC Lumberjack MDP
My second example would be a **Minecraft NPC Lumberjack**. The **states** would be any information about a certain block/grid and the tree. For the grid it would be any of the following: empty space, occupied by a tree. For the tree it would be the number of logs obtainable, and stages 1 to 5 for tree growth. The **actions** of the agent will be cutting, moving in cardinal directions, and planting. The **rewards** will be -1 at each wasted time step to encourage optimal tree gathering, +10 for each log cut, and +10 also for planting the cut down tree back.

#### Minecraft NPC Trader MDP
My third example would be a **Minecraft NPC Trader**. The **states** would represent the traderâ€™s inventory (amount of different resources like wood, stone, iron, emeralds) and the market conditions (buy/sell prices for each resource). The **actions** of the agent will be buying, selling, moving to different villages, and waiting. The **rewards** will be -1 per time step to encourage efficient trading, positive rewards based on profit from buying low and selling high, and an additional bonus for accumulating a certain amount of emeralds (e.g., +100 for reaching 50 emeralds).
