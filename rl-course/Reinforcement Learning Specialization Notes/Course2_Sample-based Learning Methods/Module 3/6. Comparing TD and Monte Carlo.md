**Learning Approach:**
- **Monte Carlo:** learns from complete episodes
- **TD Learning:** update values at each time step.

**Bootstrapping:**
- **Monte Carlo:** does not bootstrap, they rely solely on actual returns from complete episodes.
- **TD Learning:** updates estimates based on other learned estimates after each step.

**Efficiency and Variance:**
- **Monte Carlo:** can have **high variance** and **slower learning**.
- **TD Learning:** generally exhibit **lower variance** and more **efficient learning.**
