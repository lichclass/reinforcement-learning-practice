- Prediction Learning is scalable. 
- Temporal-difference learning is a method for learning to predict.
- TD learning is learning a prediction from another, later, learned prediction i.e. learning a guess from a guess.
- Works in real time
- More sample efficient as it updates after each step and not at the end of the episode.
- Used in the following areas:
	- Game AI
	- Robotics (learning motion strategies)
	- Finance (predicting stock market trends)
